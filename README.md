# Korean CSAT Math

## Project Introduction
This repository is dedicated to solving mathematics problems from the Korean CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test) and documenting the solutions on GitHub. Each problem is solved individually, with detailed explanations of the steps involved. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive collection of math problem solutions, which can serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in improving their problem-solving skills.

CSAT math problems are known for enhancing logical thinking and mathematical abilities, making this project an excellent practice resource.

## Key Features
- Solutions to problems from Math I, Math II, Calculus, Probability & Statistics, and Geometry.
- Detailed explanations of each solution.
- Optional Python code for automating and visualizing solutions.

## Project Structure
- `problems/`: Contains math problems categorized by subject.
- `solutions/`: Contains the corresponding solutions for each problem.
- `README.md`: Project overview and guide.
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) List of required packages for code execution.

## How to Use
1. Each problem is stored in the `problems/` folder, organized by subject. You can find the corresponding solution in the `solutions/` folder.
2. To view the solution, open the relevant `solution_problemNumber.py` file to see the solution process.
3. If you want to solve the problems yourself, download the files from the `problems/` folder, solve them, and add your solutions to the `solutions/` folder.
